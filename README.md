# Dependency Discovery Deck

## Overview

The Dependency Discovery Deck is a set of game cards designed to facilitate dependency detection in scaled Agile setups. Version 2.0 of the deck is now available, offering a novel approach to enhancing team communication and fostering psychological safety during meetings such as Backlog Refinement or PI Planning.

## Features

- Gamify your Dependency Detection process.
- Boost psychological safety within your team.
- Enhance structure and communication during meetings.
- Based on expert interviews, primarily conducted at MHP - A Porsche Company.

## Changes from Version 1.0 to Version 2.0

- Four Backgrounds for printing the cards.
- A card with rules.
- More focused design and descriptions.

## Usage

There are multiple ways to incorporate the Dependency Discovery Deck into your team meetings:

1. **Individual Selection** - Allow each team member to choose a card with a dependency on a feature or user story that will have an impact on their work. This encourages individual ownership and engagement in the dependency detection process.

2. **Collective Removal** - Have the team collectively remove all the cards for a feature that doesn't have dependencies. This can streamline discussions by focusing attention on features with actual dependencies, making meetings more efficient.

3. **Pair Collaboration** - Foster collaboration by having two team members share one set of cards. This encourages discussion, negotiation, and shared understanding of dependencies, ultimately strengthening teamwork and collaboration within the group.

Feel free to experiment with these options to find the approach that works best for your team dynamics and meeting objectives.

## Future Updates

- Expansion of card set with additional cards.
- Improvement of card design for better usability.
- Introduction of solution cards to address identified dependencies.
